      I started my career with a keen interest in writing and technology, which led me to explore the world of <strong>technical communication</strong>. After gaining proficiency in authoring tools like <strong>Oxygen XML</strong>, <strong>Confluence</strong>, and <strong>Madcap Flare</strong>, I shifted my focus to creating digital content that not only conveys technical information but is also user-friendly.
