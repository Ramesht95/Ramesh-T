# About me

Hello! I’m **Ramesh**, a passionate **Technical Writer** with a focus on creating clear, concise, and user-friendly documentation. Currently, I’m working at **Thryve Digital Health LLP** where I specialize in **structured authoring, technical documentation**, and **content strategy**.

## My Journey

I began my career as a **Process Associate** at **Mr. Cooper**, a leading mortgage company, where I worked in the Operations Department. My responsibility was to ensure the accuracy and quality of loan-related documents, which required attention to detail, documentation skills, and process understanding.

During this time, a friend introduced me to the field of Technical Writing. He explained the role of software documentation in bridging the gap between users and technology. His guidance and mentorship sparked my interest, and I began learning the basics of technical writing including document structuring, clarity, and industry tools.

With dedicated preparation and support, I transitioned into a new role as a **Technical Writer** at **Cognizant Technology Solutions**, Chennai. This marked a turning point in my career where I could combine my writing ability, technical curiosity, and passion for clarity into a meaningful profession.
