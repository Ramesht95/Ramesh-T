## My Journey

I began my career as a Process Associate at **Mr. Cooper**, Chennai, a leading mortgage company, where I worked in the Operations Department. My responsibility was to ensure the accuracy and quality of loan-related documents, which required attention to detail, documentation skills, and process understanding.

Over time, I developed a strong interest in documentation and the role it plays in simplifying complex information. I started learning the fundamentals of technical writing, including document structuring, clarity, and the use of industry-standard tools.

With dedicated preparation and focus, I transitioned into a new role as a Technical Writer at **Cognizant Technology Solutions**, Chennai. This marked a turning point in my career, allowing me to combine my writing ability, technical curiosity, and passion for clarity into a meaningful profession.

Currently, I’m working as a Technical Writer at **Thryve Digital Health LLP**, Chennai, where I specialize in structured authoring, technical documentation, and content strategy.
